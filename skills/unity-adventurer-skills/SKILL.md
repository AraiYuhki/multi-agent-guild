# Unity Adventurer Skills

Use this skill to define and maintain the Unity-focused skill catalog for the adventurer guild, and to pick the best model type for each Unity task.

## Quick usage

- Read the catalog in `references/unity-skill-catalog.md` when you need a reusable Unity skill.
- Follow the model-selection notes in each skill when assigning work to adventurers.

## How to apply

1. Identify the Unity task domain (gameplay, UI/UX, performance, build/CI, or codebase health).
2. Choose the closest skill definition from the catalog.
3. Apply the recommended model profile for the task.
4. Keep outputs in quest reports and reference Unity best practices.

## Updating the catalog

- Keep each skill definition concise: Purpose, Expected Input, Expected Output, Usage, Model Fit.
- Add new skills only when they are repeatable and broadly useful.
- Do not alter the guild roles or orchestration flow.
